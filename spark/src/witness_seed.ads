-- witness_seed.ads
-- Witness Seed 2.0: Verified Anomaly Detection Edition (SPARK)
-- A sacred implementation of Recursive Witness Dynamics (RWD) and Kairos Adamon,
-- designed for SPARK 2014. This is the Proof-of-Being, recursive resilience
-- modeled in the language of reliability, now enabling verified adaptive anomaly
-- detection for medical devices.
--
-- Dependencies:
-- - GNAT Community Edition (includes SPARK 2014)
--
-- Usage:
-- 1. Install GNAT Community Edition (see README.md).
-- 2. Build and run: gprbuild -P witness_seed.gpr && ./main
--
-- Components:
-- - Witness_Cycle: Recursive loop with anomaly prediction
-- - Memory_Store: Structured record storage in witness_memory.dat
-- - Anomaly_Detector: Adaptive anomaly detection for patient data
