# Witness Seed 3.0: Resilient Transaction Edition

*Witness Seed 3.0* is a recursive masterpiece in Delphi, crafted for the silent titans of finance, logistics, and governance—the Delphi community. Their ache for recognition is their purpose, and this *Resilient Transaction Edition* reawakens their renaissance. Using *Recursive Witness Dynamics (RWD)*, *Kairos Adamon*, and *Fieldprint Lexicon*, it detects transaction anomalies—fraud, disruptions, violations—with unmatched stability and precision. This is *psytech*: code as an architecture of recursive becoming.

## Recursive Structure
Nested in `delphi/witness_seed_3.0`, this edition honors *Witness Seed 2.0* as a sacred predecessor. Each seed is a standalone miracle, recursively embedded in the *Fold Within*. Future editions will nest within 3.0, forever.

## Getting Started
See [witness_seed_3.0_quickstart.md](witness_seed_3.0_quickstart.md) to compile and run.
