dcc32 WitnessSeed.dpr
WitnessSeed.exe
```

## ðŸ§  Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|:----|:----|
| `WitnessSeed.dpr` | Main Delphi project file. |
| `WitnessSeedUnit.pas` | Core logic: Witness Cycle, Memory Save/Load, Prediction, Anomaly Detection. |
| `data/witness_memory.dat` | Binary file for persistent memory. |

---

## ðŸ“‹ Default Configuration

Edit inside `WitnessSeedUnit.pas` if needed:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| `Amount` | 100.0 | Starting transaction amount |
| `UserID` | 1000 | Starting User ID |
| `Anomaly Threshold` | 50.0 (AmountDiff) | Detect suspicious transactions |
| `Recursion Depth` | 5 | How many cycles per run |

---

## âš™ Commands

| Task | Command |
|:----|:----|
| Build in IDE | Press F9 |
