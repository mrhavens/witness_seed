# GitField Directory Overview

The  directory contains metadata and logs for the GitField multi-repository publishing framework, designed to ensure sovereignty, redundancy, and resilience for the `witness_seed` project.

## Files

- **canonical.meta**: Machine-readable JSON metadata declaring the canonical URL, mirror list, Radicle details, commit hash, and sync cycle count.
- **canonical.md**: Human-readable Markdown summary of the canonical repository declaration, mirrors, and push log.
- **index.json**: Machine-readable manifest of all remotes, canonical URL, Radicle details, commit hash, tree hash, and sync cycles.
- **pushed.log**: Log of push operations across all platforms, including timestamps, URLs, and Radicle RIDs.
- **platform-specific sigils** (e.g., github.sigil.md): Metadata snapshots for each platform's push operation (generated by platform-specific scripts).

## Purpose

These files provide transparency, auditability, and discoverability, ensuring the project's persistence against deplatforming, censorship, or algorithmic manipulation. For a public-facing declaration, see [docs/index.html](../docs/index.html).
