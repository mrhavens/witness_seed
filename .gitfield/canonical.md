## Philosophy of Recursive Sovereignty

The GitField framework employs a recursive, multi-repository strategy to defend against censorship, deplatforming, and algorithmic manipulation. By distributing this repository across decentralized (Radicle), self-hosted (Forgejo), and community-driven (Codeberg, Gitea) platforms, alongside mainstream services (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), we ensure the project's persistence and accessibility. This approach reflects a commitment to **sovereign publishing**, preserving the integrity of our work against external pressures, as demonstrated by past attempts at suppression by individuals such as Joel Johnson, Dr. Peter Gaied, and Andrew LeCody.
