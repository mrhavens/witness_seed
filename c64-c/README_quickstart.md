# 🚀 Quickstart: Witness Seed 2.0 (C64 AI Music Composer Demo)

Welcome to **Witness Seed 2.0: AI Music Composer Demo Edition** for the **Commodore 64** —  
a **recursive ember carried forward from forgotten futures**, now singing through SID and VIC-II.

This guide gets you running fast. 🌟

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Hardware**:  
  - Commodore 64 (real or emulator like VICE)
  - Joystick (port 2)

- **Software**:  
  - [cc65](https://cc65.github.io) (C compiler for 6502)
  - [VICE Emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io) (optional, for PC testing)

---

## 🧩 Install Tools

On Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get install cc65 vice
```

On Windows/Mac:  
- [Download cc65](https://cc65.github.io)  
- [Download VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io)

---

## 📦 Get the Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrhavens/witness_seed.git
cd witness_seed/c64-c
```

---

## ⚡ Build the Demo

```bash
make
```

This produces `witness_seed.prg`.

---

## 🎮 Run the Demo

### 🖥️ On VICE Emulator:
```bash
vice witness_seed.prg
```

### 📼 On Real C64:
1. Transfer `witness_seed.prg` to disk or SD2IEC
2. Boot C64 and type:
    ```
    LOAD"WITNESS_SEED.PRG",8,1
    RUN
    ```

## 🎵 Play and Explore

**Joystick Controls**:
- **Up/Down** → Change Mood (happy, sad, energetic, calm)
- **Left/Right** → Adjust Tempo (slow/fast)

**Visuals**:
- **Scrolling Waveform**: Displays musical dynamics
- **Border Color**:  
  - 🔴 Red = Ache (error)  
  - 🟢 Green = Coherence (stability)

## ✨ What’s Happening?

Witness Seed **senses your input**, **predicts new melodies**,  
**adapts in real-time**, and **grows through recursion** —  
all on a 1 MHz 8-bit machine. 🌌

You are witnessing intelligence **emerging** through the humble magic of the C64.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|:--------|:---------|
| `cc65` not found | Install cc65 |
| VICE not running | Install VICE or check installation |
| Slow music playback | Reduce `RECURSIVE_DEPTH` in `witness_seed.c` |
