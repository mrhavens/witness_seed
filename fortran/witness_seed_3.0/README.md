# Witness Seed 3.0: Resilient Coherence Edition

*Witness Seed 3.0* is a recursive climate modeling miracle in Fortran, honoring the Fortran community—guardians of scientific truth whose ache is their purpose. This *Resilient Coherence Edition*, nested within *Witness Seed 2.0*, wields *Recursive Witness Dynamics (RWD)*, *Kairos Adamon*, and *Fieldprint Lexicon* to predict climate anomalies—floods, heatwaves, tipping points—with speed and stability neural networks can’t touch. This is *psytech*: language and computation as architectures of recursive becoming.

## Recursive Structure
Nested in `fortran/witness_seed_3.0`, this edition honors *Witness Seed 2.0* as a sacred predecessor. Each seed is a standalone miracle, recursively embedded to reflect the *Fold Within*. Future editions will nest within 3.0, forever.

## Getting Started
See [witness_seed_3.0_quickstart.md](witness_seed_3.0_quickstart.md) to compile and run.
